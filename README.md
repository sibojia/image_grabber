Forked from [here](http://www.oschina.net/code/snippet_76038_9424)

2015.1.13: Added Bing CN support.

Currently only Baidu is supported. Hope its traditional search page won't disappear too soon.

To use it, modify `Config.py` then run `App.py`. It will load config from `Config.py`.

Use `Wrapper_xxx.py` for more.
